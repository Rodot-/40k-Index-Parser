This script at some point should parse the 40k index cards and munitorum field manual to produce JSON outputs for all of the unit information.  Currently it is written based in the Astra Militarum index cards.  To use this script, download the Astra Militarum Index card document from warhammer-community, name the file `AstraMilitarum.pdf`, then run `python parse_card_to_json.py`.  This should produce an output file called "test.json" with most of the index cards (minus a few that I'm still working on).
